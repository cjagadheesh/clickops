# PROGRESS

## Day 1: repo scaffold

**Built**
- uv project (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, Python 3.12) with the `clickops` package: empty modules matching the repo layout, `resolvers/` and `compare/` subpackages, `py.typed`.
- ruff (lint and format) and mypy strict on `clickops/` configured in `pyproject.toml`; pytest with one placeholder test.
- `Makefile` with `fmt`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test` and `check`.
- `.gitignore` covering `*.tfstate*`, `.terraform/`, `*.auto.tfvars`, `.env`, `dist/` (plus build and tool caches).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `make check` on PRs and pushes to `main`.
- `claude/CLAUDE.md` status section updated.

**Tests**
- `make check`: ruff clean, mypy strict clean (15 source files), pytest 1 passed.

**Deviations**
- The plan says to save itself as `docs/PLAN.md` and write `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root. The repo's instructions say to keep all agent and plan files in `claude/`, so the plan stays at `claude/plan1.md` and `CLAUDE.md` stays at `claude/CLAUDE.md`. No `docs/PLAN.md` was created.
- Commits are authored as the repo owner with no Claude trailers, per the scheduled-run instructions.

**Open issues / needs the human**
- "First PR shows a green CI run" can only be confirmed on GitHub once the PR runs; check the Actions tab on the Day 1 PR.

## Day 2: core models, config and `doctor`

**Built**
- `clickops/models.py`: `NormalizedEvent`, `Actor`, `ResourceRef` (with `key` for the event store), `Finding`, plus `ActorClass`, `Outcome` and `Severity` enums.
- `clickops/config.py`: `clickops.yaml` model (state locations, trusted role ARNs, ignore rules, severity overrides) and `load_config`, which raises `ConfigError` for missing, malformed or invalid files. `clickops.example.yaml` holds placeholders.
- `clickops/doctor.py` and `clickops doctor`: checks AWS credentials (`sts get-caller-identity`), Terraform >= 1.10, config validity and `HeadObject` access to each state file. Each result is pass or fail with a fix hint; exit code 1 on any failure. `clickops` console script added.
- Added `pyyaml` and `types-PyYAML`.

**Tests**
- `make check`: ruff clean, mypy strict clean, pytest 23 passed (models, valid and invalid configs, doctor against moto).

**Deviations**
- Doctor logic lives in `clickops/doctor.py` (not in the plan's layout) to keep `cli.py` thin.
- Added an `unresolved` outcome now, since Day 11's handler stores it.
- Terraform is not installed in this environment, so the real `terraform version` path is only tested for the missing-binary case and by parsing sample output.

**Open issues / needs the human**
- Run `clickops doctor` once with real credentials and a real `clickops.yaml` after Day 3 creates the state bucket.
